   <h5>I have been OBSESSING over these pants forever. <br>They’re so expensive, but I feel like they’re so worth it, they’re absolutely gorgeous.</h5>

<img src="img /clock.jpg" alt="a picture of different times of the morning and afternoon on a black apple background, alarm clocks"/>
<h5> I have so many early alarms, I’m not an early bird, though, but I did fix my sleep schedule. <br>I go to sleep earlier than usual and wake up early. I feel like I need to fix how late I am for class, though.</h5>

<h5> My music taste is so diverse, I literally listen to anything, country, metal, rock, rap, etc. My favorite genres I feel like, are nu-metal, post-hardcore, kpop (k-r&b hits too), and hip-hop/rap.
    <br>I really have been getting more into J.cole, one of my brothers’ is obsessed with him. As I’m getting more into punk ideals, I feel like the more I’ve gotten into hip-hop, like j.cole, mac miller, 
    <br>public enemy, etc. Hip-hop is one of the most punk genres and I feel like people don’t realize that because they only listen to what’s mainstream 
    (a lot of it also being racism) <br>but so many artists talked about political issues. Anyways I’m ranting but yea I love music.</h5>

    <h5>I love going out with my bf, and most of the time when I hang out with people, it’s him and his friends. They kind of expect me to come with them all the time.<br> I’m happy they like me and don’t mind if I hang out with them. Feel like my friends are the same way, too.</h5>

 <h5>I find so many cool posters on the street, sometimes I get kinda mad though because I had this one project where I had to <br>find posters and flyers, and could barely find any. Now after the project, I see so many.</h5>

<h5>I watch youtube an unhealthy amount, I used to watch a lot of horror-related and scary content. But now I watch a lot of cooking, skincare, makeup, haul, etc videos. <br>I feel like this reflects how my mental health has gotten better and I’m doing better in life, I’m in my soft girl era.</h5>

   <h5>Anyways, we went to a hardcore show. It was funny because every break, I got on Temple Run and got a new high score. I actually almost threw up that night, might have gotten too high, plus I was sick, and there were so many people, lights, just a lot going on. I had fun, though, the music was good, and everyone was having fun.</h5>
